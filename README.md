# Bharat Internship Tasks

This repository contains the completed tasks for my internship at Bharat Intern. The tasks are related to stock prediction, Titanic classification, and handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

## Task 1: Stock Prediction using LSTM

In this task, I utilized the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the stock price of a chosen company. The Jupyter Notebook for this task contains the data preprocessing steps, LSTM model implementation, and visualization of the predicted stock prices.

## Task 2: Titanic Classification System

For Task 2, I developed a classification system to predict whether a person would survive the Titanic sinking. The Jupyter Notebook includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more were considered in building the predictive model.

## Task 3: Handwritten Digit Recognition

Task 3 involves building a handwritten digit recognition system using the popular MNIST dataset. The Jupyter Notebook includes data preprocessing, model training using deep learning techniques, and visualizations to showcase the accuracy of the recognition system.

## Jupyter Notebook Access

To access and interact with the Jupyter Notebooks for each task, you can clone this repository to your local machine. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. Once cloned, open the notebooks with the .ipynb extension using Jupyter Notebook to explore the code, visualizations, and comments.

## Installation and Dependencies

The tasks were completed using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and various data science and deep learning libraries. The required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install the dependencies, use the following command:
